This repo. is the official implementation of "Segmentation of Breast Tubules in H&E Images Based on a DKS-DoubleU-Net Model" .  
Please see the [paper](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/2961610/).  
## Overview
## Run  
1.Requirements:  
* python3  
* tensorflow 2.3.0  
* keras 1.0.8  
We have uploaded the corresponding environment package for your convenience.  

2.Training:  
* Prepare the required images and store them in new_data floder, set up training image folders and validation image folders respectively.
* Run ``` python train.py```  

3.Testing:
* Run ```python predict.py```

In the pre_trained folder we have uploaded the model trained on our dataset.
